# Our custom modification to the mmpose toolkit  
We only run inference on mmpose's model. No pipeline is being modified.

## Download Checkpoints for RTMPose
RTMPose checkpoints can be found at the model zoo of the official mmpose repo. Ex: `rtmpose-l_simcc-aic-coco_pt-aic-coco_420e-256x192-f016ffe0_20230126.pth`

You can put it checkpoints to `checkpoints/` directory.

For example: 
```
/home/cvlab123/mmpose/checkpoints/rtmpose-l_simcc-aic-coco_pt-aic-coco_420e-256x192-f016ffe0_20230126.pth
```
